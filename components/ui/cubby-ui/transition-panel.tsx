// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Alternative implementation note (Motion / FLIP)

// The height animation here is D-tier in the render-pipeline classification
// (animates the real `height` CSS property → triggers layout per frame). The
// cost is negligible for the typical popover/panel use case: isolated subtree,
// brief interaction-driven transition, small content area.
//
// If a future consumer has a high-frequency or large-surface use case where
// S-tier (compositor-only) height animation matters, the Motion-based
// alternative looks like:
//
//   <motion.div layout>                  // parent: animates via transform:scale
//     {views.map(({ key, node }) => (
//       <motion.div key={key} layout="position">
//         {node}                          // layout="position" applies inverse
//       </motion.div>                     // scale so descendants don't warp
//     ))}
//   </motion.div>
//
// Trade-offs to consider before switching:
//   + S-tier height animation (composite-only, runs on the compositor thread).
//   − Adds ~25–30kb gzipped Motion dep to any consumer that doesn't already
//     use Motion. That's the main reason this primitive defaults to CSS.
//   − Every direct view wrapper needs `layout="position"`; miss one and the
//     parent's scale transform warps that subtree.
//   − Motion's FLIP measurement adds edge cases (rapid swaps, interrupted
//     transitions) that the CSS path avoids.
//
// Recommendation: keep CSS as the default for design-system reuse; switch to
// Motion in a fork or sibling component when there's actual measured need.

/**
 * Animated swap between N named views. Direction-aware: tracks the previous
 * activeKey, compares its position in the view registry to the new one,
 * and slides forward (entering view from the right / down) or backward
 * (entering view from the left / up) accordingly.
 *
 * Pure CSS animation — no Motion. Uses `@starting-style` for the entry
 * keyframe, `transition-discrete` for the `display: block ↔ none` swap of
 * inactive views, and CSS custom properties for direction-aware slide
 * values. Height animates via `useAnimatedHeight` (ResizeObserver writes a
 * pixel height onto the outer container, CSS transitions it).
 *
 * Compound component pattern: state is shared with `TransitionPanelView`
 * via `TransitionPanelContext`. Each view renders its own DOM and reads
 * `activeKey`, axis, direction-aware CSS vars, and the `mounted` gate from
 * context. Views register themselves with the panel via the context's
 * `registerView` callback; the registry is the source of truth for view
 * order (used by direction calculation) and view DOM lookup (used by the
 * focus effect). On registration we re-derive order from DOM position, so
 * a view that unmounts and remounts (conditional rendering, Suspense,
 * lazy-loaded content) gets its source-order slot back instead of being
 * appended at the end of the Map.
 *
 * Composability: `TransitionPanelView` does not have to be a direct child
 * of `TransitionPanel`. Views can be wrapped in HOCs, fragments, error
 * boundaries, Suspense boundaries, or conditional/mapped renderings — all
 * routing through context.
 *
 * Inactive views are marked `inert` so focus can't land on hidden controls
 * during the swap's exit transition (display stays `block` for ~240ms while
 * the leaving view fades out under `transition-discrete`). Focus is moved
 * to the new view's target in `useLayoutEffect` so it happens before the
 * browser paints — minimizing the window where focus has been released by
 * the inert flip on the outgoing view but not yet moved to the incoming
 * one. Consumers can still opt out per-view via `initialFocus={false}`.
 *
 * Spread accepts any `<div>` prop (`id`, `role`, `aria-label`, `ref`,
 * `data-*`, etc.). The optional `ref` is composed with an internal ref
 * used for height measurement.
 *
 * Data attributes (Base UI conventions):
 *   - Root: `data-axis="x" | "y"`,
 *           `data-activation-direction="left" | "right" | "up" | "down" | "none"`
 *   - View: `data-active` (presence when active), `data-viewkey="..."`
 *
 * CSS custom properties (set on root, inherited by views):
 *   - `--tp-duration` (default `240ms`) — height + slide transition duration.
 *     Override per-instance via `style` prop or per-app via CSS rule.
 *
 * Browser support: the entrance animation relies on `@starting-style` and
 * `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` (Chrome 117+, Safari 17.4+,
 * Firefox 129+). Older browsers degrade to an instant view swap with no
 * slide animation — no broken state, just no motion.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```tsx
 * <TransitionPanel activeKey={step} axis="x">
 *   <TransitionPanelView viewKey="list">...</TransitionPanelView>
 *   <TransitionPanelView viewKey="create">...</TransitionPanelView>
 * </TransitionPanel>
 * ```
