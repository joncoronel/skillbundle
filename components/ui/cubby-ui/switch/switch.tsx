/**
 * Thumb classes. Every declaration reads a custom property the root supplies,
 * so this is only correct as a direct child of an element carrying
 * `switchVariants`. Unexported for that reason.
 *
 * The two motions travel by different means, which is the whole reason this is
 * a variant rather than one class list. `stretch` moves the thumb's two edges
 * on separate schedules — no single transform expresses that, so it animates
 * `left`/`right` and pays for a layout pass per frame. `default` moves both
 * edges in lockstep at a constant width, which IS a translate, so it uses one
 * and the compositor runs it off the main thread. Routing `default` through the
 * layout path too (as this once did) meant the common case paid the rare case's
 * cost: interpolating a custom property on the main thread, then relayouting
 * and repainting the thumb every frame. Cheap on a desktop, visibly janky on a
 * phone, especially inside a Drawer that is already compositing hard.
 *
 * The compositor path is only clean where nothing else is moving, which means a
 * coarse pointer — the case that needed it. A desktop toggle almost always
 * fires mid-hover, so --switch-ext is retracting from the press across the same
 * frames and the width is not constant after all. Desktops could always afford
 * that; the point was never to spare them.
