      {/* The three icons crossfade in place, so they share one grid cell.
          This wrapper owns that grid rather than styling Button's internal
          content span through `[&>span]`. That span is Button's private DOM,
          and reaching for it is not a theoretical risk: it did not exist until
          the Button redesign added it, so for every release before that one
          `[&>span]` matched these three icons themselves and stacked nothing —
          they sat side by side, two of them invisible but still taking width.
          The selector did not break, it silently changed which element it
          meant, in both directions, unnoticed.

          `grid-template-areas` on the Button root was inert throughout: the
          root is `inline-flex`, so it is not a grid. Declaring the area here
          is what lets `[grid-area:stack]` below resolve by name rather than
          through the implicit-line fallback it has been leaning on. */}

  // Presentational, so a conforming reader prunes the semantics of everything
  // inside it — a live region in there is not a live region. This is why the
  // fixed `aria-label` above is safe: the region genuinely does the reporting.
  //
  // Suppressed entirely when a toast is attached, which says the same words out
  // loud on its own.
  //
  // `display: contents` rather than a bare fragment, so the component still
  // resolves to one element for anything that counts them — `Children.only`,
  // a `render` prop, `:only-child`, `> * + *`. It adds no box, so it creates no
  // containing block and the absolutely-positioned floating variant in
